# Voice-For-IOT-BRIDGE

This is a tasker xml project used to bridge the "Voice For IOT" android app and AutoVoice

This xml only works with the paid version of AutoVoice. AutoVoice is requred for this xml to work.

Place a copy of the xml in your tasker folder "projects" then import into tasker. Make sure all profiles are enabled, then in the "Voice For IOT" app go to "Voice For IOT Bridge", then click "update bridge". You should see a toast message showing that the variables were updated.  You should now be able to launch "Voice For IOT" from any AutoVoice Action such as an action from a Google Now Search.  Be sure to update the bridge when ever "Voice For IOT" data is changed.
